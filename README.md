# cmake-find-modules
My collection of CMake Find modules, for CMake 3.8+
This repository exists because many of the find modules elsewhere on the Internet are broken, outdated, or unnecessarily complicated.
I aim to write my own modules using newer CMake 3+, syntax with namespaced imports.

Licensed under BSD 3-clause, same as the other find modules in CMake.
